In this code, I had to look up the Plotly.js documentation provided in the instructions of the assignment to be able to figure out how to create a bubble chart. I also had to ask the Xpert learning assistant on how to iterate through objects since I kept getting an error found in the console: app.js:19 Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: result.forEach is not a function. I looked up the problem and most of the results that came up required me to create an array, so I asked the learning assistant and it gave me the method of Object.keys() which worked and I was able to get the sidebar with the information of the samples for the demographic info.
